# Project-1

This project aims to provide trend analysis for Denver Metro crimes. 
The primary focus will be the most frequently occurring crimes with the goal of showing where, when, and to whom these crimes occur.

Data Types include:
Geodata, string, integer, and weather data

The follwing visualizations will be used:
Time of day (histograms), time of year(line), type of crime (heatmap, pie chart), relationship to offender (pie Chart), location (heatmap), Top five types of crime.

Benefits of project:
Our project will answer a range of questions pertinent to all Denverites.  From the newcomer wanting to know what neighborhoods are the safest, to the business owner wondering what time of day most robberies occur.  Additional questions we plan to answer are;
1.    What type of crimes are on the rise?
2.    Are certain areas more crime ridden?
3.    Where are the safest neighborhoods?
4.    How does time of day affect the likelihood of a crime occurring?
